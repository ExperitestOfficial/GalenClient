This project enable you to integrate Galen visual validation into your Selenium tests.
It dosn't require any code changes to your test but adding a single line of code into the validation points.

To build your Galen spec please use the following Chrome extension:

First you need to configure your access key:
in.Visual.setAccessKey(< access key >);

You will find your access key in the in the extension.
